1. Status for the bus time is calculated as follows
```
  if deviationFromTimetable >= 275 then Late
  else if deviationFromTimetable <= -200 then Early
  else if (deviationFromTimetable > -200 || deviationFromTimetable < 275) then On Time
  else Unknown
```
2. First string(separated by a space) in route variant is considered as bus no (if the length is less than 2, Unknown is displayed in the UI)
3. Due to lack of time, only 10 tests have been written.
4. Notes can be added and has a data binding(but won't be retained if you refresh the page, No deletion, validation)
5. CSS can be improved(haven't used any frameworks(eg: Bootstrap). Expandable/Collapsable css can include icon as well.
6. Data is fetched from the json file. In the real world example, we usually get them via external service using HttpClient.
